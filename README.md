# Best Fit Circle

This repository uses Java and Swing to implement a program that takes a number of selected points on a graph and plots the best fitting circle for those points.

It accomplishes this by creating a matrix for the general form equation of a circle, and solving a system of equations to find the center and radius of the best fitting circle.
